# ArcadeSurvival
A rogue-like shoot'em up arena survival game I made for university assignment.  
You spawn in the middle of arena, fighting waves of enemies, building up Ascended Form meter and picking up buffs (or debuffs).  
You use WASD to move, Space to shoot and E to activate Ascended Form.

# Libraries used  
- [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)  
# Build
The project is made purely with Visual Studio 2022, and back when I made this I had worse of an idea of how to structure my repo in a way that one could just build it, so one would probably need to link SFML himself.
