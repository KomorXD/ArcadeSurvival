# ArcadeSurvival
A rogue-like shoot'em up arena survival game I made for university assignment.  
You spawn in the middle of arena, fighting waves of enemies, building up Ascended Form meter and picking up buffs (or debuffs).  
You use WASD to move, Space to shoot and E to activate Ascended Form.  
# Libraries used  
- [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)  
# Build
The project is made purely with Visual Studio 2022 IIRC, so you need that to run.  
Also back when I made this I had no idea about project/repo setup so you kinda have to link SFML yourself, or perhaps it should work I can't recall really and noone will pull it so w/e.
